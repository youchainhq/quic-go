# About this fork of quic-go

This's a fork from [quic-go](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/).

The ONLY purpose of this fork is to fix the [issue 2363](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/issues/2326) for version `v0.14.*` .

If you can use any version later than quic-go v0.14.4, then you definitely SHOULD use the official [quic-go](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/quic-go/).
